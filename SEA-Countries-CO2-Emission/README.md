# SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTRIES CO2 EMISSION :earth_asia:

Dataset is from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/co2-data)

## Context :green_book:

### Problem Statement :rotating_light:
Carbon dioxide emission are the primary catalyst of global climate change. The WHO predict that heat exposure caused by increased temperatures will be the largest health impact of climate change. Therefore, this project is about analyzing C02 emission which heavily focused on Southeast Asian countries.  

### Approach 
1. Firstly, I downloaded the dataset from Our World in Data. Then imported the file with the help of **Pandas**.
2. Analyzing the data by figuring out number of columns and rows as well as the number of null values in every column. I filled the null values with 0. 
3. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization by Panel/Hvplot
4. Created the dashboard at [here](http://localhost:5006/CO2_Dashboard)
