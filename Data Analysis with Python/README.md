- I enrolled into this course in June/July 2022 and finally 'graduated' in September 2022. There was a big gap in this journey to complete the course. I was learning too many things at one time. While learning about data analysis, I was so busy learning statistics and machine learning :weary: - Don't repeat my mistakes! Focus one course at the time. 

- My advice to anyone who's planning to enroll this course is, 

## SKIPPED THE VIDEOS AND DO THE HANDS ON EXERCISES.

You will learn faster that way. Make sure you understand the things that you code.
